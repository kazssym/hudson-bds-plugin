# READ ME

This directory contains the source code for a plugin for [Jenkins][] to let
users select [RAD Studio][] versions in their build projects.

Although RAD Studio (Delphi and C++Builder) projects can be build with much
famous [MSBuild Plugin][], users must set up version-specific environment
variables by hand.
